Today I went to the dark forest behind the skyscraper.
 I met with a scary gingerbread man dressed in flowy pants from Urban Outfitters.
 He asked the mice flying overhead if they understood database architecture.
 Unsurprisingly, they responded by laughing and shouting "of course not."
 I decided to force them to install MongoDB on Mac.
They couldn't even find the terminal window. The gingerbread man hired a
data scientist from Forge to help, but couldn't pay the exorbitant tuition,
so instead decided to nap.
