This has been five words
There once was a man
Born in Fresh Bel Air
And one day he decided
That he would dunk ducks
And on other days he...
Played Dark Souls for free
Sometimes, he enjoyed some tea
Others, he freestyled on fools
He always liked using tools
And discard the old mules
And he also did stuff
Rhyming with Java the Hutt
Playing with lighsabers and blasters
Paying homage to Mickey Mouse
Disney is going pretty crazy
With their Disney cruise ads 
Going to kick back, relax
And listen to Stevie Wonder
