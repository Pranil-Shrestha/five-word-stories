Franky and yusef

They did not want this. That angry cat had rabies. Panic ran through its owner! The cat bit the newborn. Now, both were having convulsions. It started to snow heavily. The phone line was dead. They were in Palm Springs. "Apocalyptic," thought the scared adult.
 The snow was just soap. They tried hosing it down. The cat swiftly ran inside. The baby then crawled 
outside. The cat found the mushrooms. It said, "Cook this now."  But they were psychedelic shrooms.
