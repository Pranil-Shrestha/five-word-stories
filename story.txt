A turtle walks into a large river filled with hares. The turtle, shocked, starts to sing As It Was by Roman and Sarrah horribly off-key. Hares join in, adding a harmony that sounds much better. All of a sudden, Sarrah noticed a flock of crazy chihuahas and pandas galore. Roman loudly gasped, "What the hoos is going on here!?". One chihuahua, Gerard, exclaimed saying, "I'm too tiny for this." Gerard jumped in the water and met Prince Philip in a deep, underwater painting. Roman jumped in a pool of lard, and Sarrah started eating some. We both reincarnated as turtles.
